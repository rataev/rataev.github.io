<ul>
  <li>Collected and systematized a lot of disparate information about the data entering the system.
  Documented all the artifacts in the knowledge base (1,600 pages in Confluence) regarding functionality details, data sources, architecture and etc.</li>
  <li>Developed a method for processing incoming data streams, a system architecture and a prototype for 3 streams, 
  which allows supporters to quickly analyze and detect errors in the input data stream, 
  as well as repeat loading, which greatly simplifies the search and correction of errors in the data stream and incorrectly processed records. 
  After the pilot, all the remaining (more than 40 streams) sources were similarly redone.</li>
  <li>Developed the system core for integration and load testing built into the system, generating reports in Allure and suitable for running in CI/CD Jenkins. 
  Thanks to the system, it was possible to identify and measure the gradual degradation of the system speed (deterioration by 4 times) over the course of two years, 
  which customers did not notice, and take measures to correct the situation.</li>
  <li>Gathered unique competencies in the subject area of the system, which helped to formulate requirements clearly, negotiate reasonably with other departments, 
  and transfer fully developed and formulated requirements to development, which made it possible to shorten the development-testing cycle many times over.</li>
  <li>Gained experience in negotiations and work in complex multi-team interactions in a large corporation that allows me to feel confident not only as part of the development, 
  but also as an expert who understands the product, sees how its value for customers can be increased, and can plan/organize this process at minimal cost.</li>
